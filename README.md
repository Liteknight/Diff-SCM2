# Diff-SCM

## Overview

Diff-SCM aims at developing solutions based diffusion probabilistic modeling (DPM) for causal machine learning. Our algorithms perform counterfactual inference using Pearl's abduction-action-prediction strategy using a deterministic inference based on [DDIM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.02502).
